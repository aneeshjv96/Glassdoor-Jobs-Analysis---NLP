I have scraped the data for Data Scientist role and scraped upto 1000 roles.

The webscraper code used can be found in file 'Glassdoor_scraper.py'

Data has been saved as 'EDA Data.csv' after analysis and Data Wrangling.

This file is used for Data Modelling in the python notebook file 'Glassdoor Job Postings - Data Modelling.ipynb'
